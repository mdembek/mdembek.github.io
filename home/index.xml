I am a father-to-be, a husband, and a dedicated community volunteer. I am the elected President of the Canadian Polish Congress in British Columbia and the lead Project Manager for Barka Canada. I&amp;rsquo;ve previously been involved with great organizations such as Migrant Info Point as an anti-discrimination trainer, volunteered at the Surrey Food Bank and my local RCMP district. I got involved in my community because I&amp;rsquo;m concerned for my family&amp;rsquo;s future and the kind of community they&amp;rsquo;re going to inherit.</description></item></channel></rss>
